OpenEmbedded/Yocto layer for Go language support
================================================

A repository for Go language recipes, including:

 * The Go toolchain and runtime from the Go Project (http://golang.org)
     - adapted to build native, cross, crosssdk, cross-canadian, nativesdk
 * Recipes for packages written in Go
 * A bbclass for simplifying the creation of recipes for Go packages
     - automatically generates ptest packages using go test framework

Package dependencies are specified in recipes.  By default,
packages use AUTOREV floating revisions, but you can lock down
specific versions using SRCREV overrides for packages you include
in your build.

Recipe naming convention:

 * All recipes begin with `golang-'
 * Package recipes are named based on the import path, typically
   omitting the hosting site's domain name but including the
   rest of the path with hyphens in place of slashes.  Packages
   using meta-tag references (such as those using gopkg.in) do
   include the domain name.

This layer depends on:
